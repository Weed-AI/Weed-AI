## Privacy Statement – Weed-AI
 
The University of Sydney is committed to protecting your privacy and processing your personal information fairly and lawfully, in compliance with the NSW Privacy and Personal Information Protection Act 1998.
 
### Weed-AI personal information collection
 
Weed-AI is a research tool to support computer vision for site-specific weed control.
 
If you choose to upload crop images to Weed-AI, you will need to create a registered user account on the app using an user name and email address.
 
Your user name and email address will not be viewable via the app’s public interface but will be accessible to app administrators. For administrators, your user name and email address will also be associated with any images you upload.
 
If registered users attach GPS information to their images or associated metadata, this may be identifying information in some circumstances. Users must note that the image upload processes for Weed-AI will not remove EXIF data from images, which can contain location data.
 
Personal information is not collected when public users view, analyse or download datasets.
 
### Use of your personal information
 
For registered users who upload data, app administrators will only use your account information to contact you regarding the data you upload to Weed-AI or to support your use of the Weed-AI, and to inform you of updates to Weed-AI if you do not opt out. App administrators are University employees and may in future also be community curators. All administrators are authorised and are aware of their responsibilities to protect personal information.
 
The University will also use a minimal build of Google Analytics to monitor aggregated data from Web App for reporting, analytics and improvement purposes. You may opt out of this tracking at any time by activating the “Do Not Track” setting in your browser.
 
### Retention of your personal information
 
User account data will be subject to ongoing retention, unless the user requests its deletion, to enable ongoing authentication and ongoing dataset management.
 
Uploaded images and datasets will published online using a CC BY or CC BY SA 4.0 license, and uploaders must be authorised to share the content under the license they select.
 
Images and datasets will be retained indefinitely to support long term research needs.
 
Web App data is stored securely and backed up on servers in Sydney, Australia.
 
### Your rights of access and correction
 
You have the right to access and correct your personal information held by the University. Should you wish to access, amend or delete your information in the web app, please contact [m.j.walsh@sydney.edu.au](mailto:m.j.walsh@sydney.edu.au).
