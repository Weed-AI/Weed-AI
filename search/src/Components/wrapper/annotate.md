# Annotate Your Images

**[Weed-AI Annotation Platform](https://weed-ai.sydney.edu.au/cvat-annotation/auth/login)**

We provide support for image annotation using our own version of the leading open-source annotation tool [CVAT](https://www.cvat.ai/).

## User Guide

### Getting Started

Once you've signed up for an account and logged into CVAT, you will arrive at this page:

CVAT is a powerful and feature rich annotation tool. Find out more about how to use these features using the [official guide](https://opencv.github.io/cvat/docs/manual/basics/).

A typical workflow would be to upload a set of images, and create an annotation task. Annotation tasks allow you to define what possible things should be annotated in the images (e.g. which species of plants) and what type of annotations are needed (e.g. bouding boxes or segmentation polygons). Once a task is created, you can either take it on yourself and start annotating images, or you can assign it to someone else to complete later.

### Upload to Weed-AI

Once you've finished annotating a set of images and want to bring those images across to Weed-AI, you can do this from Weed-AI:

Selecting "Annotation Project" will then allow to bring in annotations that have been made using CVAT.
