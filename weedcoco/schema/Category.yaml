      A category for an annotation, consisting of an agricultural role and
      optionally a biological name, separated by ": ". Currently allowed
      agricultural roles are "weed" and "crop".  The "none" category may be
      used to indicate that no weed or crop is identified in the image.

      Annotations should be labelled with the most specific category possible,
      usually "weed: <species name>", but super categories may be more general.
      Biological names should be lowercase.
      For an unspecified species of weed, "weed: UNSPECIFIED" may be used.

      For example, to label an oat crop in an image, the category name would be
      "crop: avena sativa". Its super categories may include "crop: grasses"
      and "crop". Oats as a volunteer crop would be "weed: avena sativa".
