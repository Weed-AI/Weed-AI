        description: |-
          A category for an annotation, consisting of an agricultural role and
          optionally a biological name, separated by ": ". Currently allowed
          agricultural roles are "weed" and "crop".  The "none" category may be
          used to indicate that no weed or crop is identified in the image.

          Annotations should be labelled with the most specific category possible,
          usually "weed: <species name>".
          Biological names should be lowercase.
          Categories labelling a higher-level taxonomic grouping are also
          permitted, also using their lowercase scientific name, such as
          "weed: poaceae" for grasses.
          For an unspecified species of weed, "weed: UNSPECIFIED" may be used.

          For example, to label an oat crop in an image, the category name would be
          "crop: avena sativa". Its super categories may include "crop: poaceae"
          and "crop". Oats as a volunteer crop would be "weed: avena sativa".
